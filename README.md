# Encryptor

## Intro

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TimHugh/encryptor/master/screenshot.png)

A simple tool to pass messages using an encrypted URL and a secret key. No data is sent over the internet, and no data is saved by the site. The URL can be safely passed around in public and can only be decoded using the key.
